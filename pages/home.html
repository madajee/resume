                <p>I graduated with BE degree from Amravati University and later completed my MS from Illinois Institute of Technology. It was 7 years fun and I got a job with Deloitte, hooray...</p>

                <p>What can you expect when you get to travel for client projects and learn from amazing Deloitte Managers and Partners. While working for Deloitte, I focused on ERP and Enterprise Integration projects. I guess after 3 years, I wasn't up for a carry-on and hotel room.</p>

                <p>What an awesome 3 years it has been Infosys, where I learned to lead interface tracks, experienced transformation at scale, enjoyed the food in Infosys campus.</p>

                <p>It was a fun culture, and I still remember the company picnic at Cincinnati RED stadium. I was a part of Data Services team developing OSB integrations to enable Logisctics and HR usecases between on-premise and cloud enterprise systems.</p>
                <p>I guess, being 6 years as a consultant, I accepted an offer with Chiquita and gave my consulting career a pause for sometime.</p>
