          <p>I realized the Integration Shift, started exploring open source ecosystems and with my integration expertise, I chose to lean MULE ESB. Though I was working as an Integrtion Consultant, I was always enabling Application Developers and understood that I need to understand how the Front End & Back End are evolving in open source Ecosystem. I was extensively leading with SOA and OSB tools, and started commiting some of my learnings to my git repo with Ruby/Rails & Spring Tutorials. I also became a MULE certified API Associate.</p>
          <p>At Hexaware, I worked for couple of clients and travelled from my base location, and leveraged my consulting experience to enable peers and teams to mordernize legacy stacks on AngularJS and Spring Stacks.</p>

        <p>After listening to few talks and a failed project, I have to learn some under the hood aspects of Javascript and took couple of courses on Javascript, NodeJS and Angular.</p>
        <p>I got a consutling opportunity with MS3 and backfilled the architect on cloud to cloud integrations between Salesforce & Aria for few months. With a meetup, I was somewhat guided that Trailhead is the way to learn Salesforce Ecosystem.</p>
        <p>I decided on develop some capabilities on MEAN stack, so I started working on my personal website. A friend of mine helped me overcome travel by pushing my candidature and I got few months at my base location. I also got some exposure with Scrum activities and became a Scrum Certified Professional.</p>
