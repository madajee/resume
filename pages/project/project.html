          <p>I realized the Integration Shift, started exploring open source ecosystems and with my integration expertise, I chose to lean MULE ESB. Though I was working as an Integrtion Consultant, I was always enabling Application Developers and understood that I need to understand how the Front End & Back End are evolving in open source Ecosystem. I was extensively leading with SOA and OSB tools, and started commiting some of my learnings to my git repo with Ruby/Rails & Spring Tutorials. I also became a MULE certified API Associate.</p>
          <p>At Hexaware, I worked for couple of clients and travelled from my base location, and leveraged my consulting experience to enable peers and teams to mordernize legacy stacks on AngularJS and Spring Stacks.</p>
          <p>I got a consutling opportunity with MS3 and backfilled the architect on cloud to cloud integrations between Salesforce & Aria for few months. With a meetup, I was somewhat guided that Trailhead is the way to learn Salesforce Ecosystem.After listening to few talks and a failed project, I have to learn some under the hood aspects of Javascript and took couple of courses on Javascript, NodeJS and Angular.</p>
          <p>I decided on develop some capabilities on MEAN stack, so I started working on my personal website. A friend of mine helped me overcome travel by pushing my candidature and I got few months at my base location. I also got some exposure with Scrum activities and became a Scrum Certified Professional.</p>

        <p>I enrolled at MongoDB universitry, and completed M001, M103 and M121. I enhanced my website with Express Server and Mongo Collection. On and off, I was blogging to retain my learnability. I got another contractual opportunity in understanding As-Is monolith application running on mule community edition and helped the team explored the upgrade path to mule enterprise / microservices / or other open source integration stacks</p>
        <p>With some heroku skills, and ability to understand Java Application Architecture, I worked as a freelancer in a blockchain startup and build an AngularJS test portal which enabled NodeJS developers to refine their Registration and Chaining APIs. A lot was happening in my family, and my spouse and I decided to relocate back to Bangalore.</p>

        <p>While in Banglore, I appeared for few interviews and landed an Mule C4E consultant contractual role at one of the retail clients of Cap Gemini. I leveraged my consulting background and mule expertise to reverse engineer existing mule APIs and provided the complexity & estimation plan as a deliverable to client & partner team. While working for Apisero, I worked as mule developer and developed few Mule 4 interafces for a retail client.</p>
